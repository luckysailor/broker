# Add Quickbase Table Configuration here
#
# Give each app an easy to remember/type name for broker to use
# Tables should also be given a simple short name
#
# This config file will be used to generate the sync queue and to connect to the corresponding apps in quickbase
# Don't check this into version control, keep this private
#
# EXAMPLES
